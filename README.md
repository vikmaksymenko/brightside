BrightSide
==========

BrightSide is a simple tool for proxing Selenium grid sessions. It's designed as a tool for running browser containers in a Kubernetes cluster, but it can be extended for proxying any Selenium grid session.

## Usage

### Python 3
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Docker 
**TBD**

## Supported platforms

- Selenium grid (not very useful, but OK as a proof of concept)
- Docker (creating and managing containers with browsers)
- Kubernetes - **TBD**
